A frog in a well knows nothing of the sea.
The mouth is the source of disaster.
The nail that sticks out is struck.
Those who chase two hares wonâ€™t even catch one.
Even a sea bream loses its flavor when eaten alone.
Even monkeys fall off their trees.
When the crow spread its wings, a pear fell from the pear-tree
Programming isn't about what you know; it's about what you can figure out.
Sometimes it's better to leave something alone, to pause, and that's very true of programming.
In some ways, programming is like painting. You start with a blank canvas and certain basic raw materials. You use a combination of science, art, and craft to determine what to do with them.
Testing leads to failure, and failure leads to understanding.
